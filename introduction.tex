%In this first of three reports, the object is to apply methods learned in the first 4 weeks in the DTU course \textit{02450 Introduction to Machine Learning and Data Mining}. The tools focus on feature extraction and visualization, and this report should give a basic understanding of our data set. The subsequent reports 2 and 3 will deal with further analysis of the data.

% The objective of this second report is to apply the methods you have learned in the second section of the course on ”Supervised learning: Classification and regression” in order to solve both a relevant classification and regression problem for your data.

\textbf{Objective:} In this second of three reports, the objective is to apply methods learned in weeks 5 through 8 in the DTU course \textit{02450 Introduction to Machine Learning and Data Mining}. The tools focus on supervised learning, in particular regression and classification. This report outlines how we solved a classification problem and a regression problem for our data using different methods learned in the course.

\textbf{Material and tools:} The terms and notations used correspond to the notation in the course note \cite{coursenotes}, and we make use of scripts provided by the 02450Toolbox for Python 3 and Matlab.
