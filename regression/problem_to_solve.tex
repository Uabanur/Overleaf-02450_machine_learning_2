As mentioned in the previous report\footnote{Report 1, section 2.4 \textit{Primary machine learning modeling aim}}, an interesting question in the field of material science would be \textcolor{blue}{"Can we predict the refractive index of a piece of glass given the chemical
composition?"}
Specifically for our data the set, the question becomes: \textcolor{blue}{Can we predict the value of attribute \texttt{RI} from the 8 weight percent attributes?} In order to answer this question, we apply two methods: linear regression with forward selection to the data, and an artificial neural network (ANN). Then we evaluate if there is a significant performance difference between
the obtained models from the two methods.
