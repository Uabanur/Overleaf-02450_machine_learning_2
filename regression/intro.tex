In this section, we outline how we solved a relevant regression problem for our data. In report 1, we found that we had 9 continuous ratio attributes; 8 weight percent attributes (\texttt{Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Ba, Fe}), and the refractive index \texttt{RI}. As explained in report 1, the refractive index \texttt{RI} is a real number representing \texttt{RI}$ =\frac{c}{v}$, where $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum, and $v$ is the speed of light in the current medium.
